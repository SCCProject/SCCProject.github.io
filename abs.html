				<h2>Living with SCC</h2>
					<p>
						SCC is considered one of the most beatable cancers, because it is very uncommon for this cancer to spread to the lymph nodes. 
					</p>

				<h2>Treatments</h2>
					<p>
						Curettage and electrodessication: This treatment consists of two steps. First, your dermatologist scrapes away the tumor. Then electricity is used to destroy any remaining cancer cells. These two steps are repeated.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lymph node dissection: Removing regional (nearby) lymph nodes is recommended for some squamous cell carcinomas that are very large or deeply invasive and in cases where the lymph nodes feel enlarged and/or hard. After the lymph nodes are removed, they are looked at under a microscope to see if they contain cancer cells. In some cases, radiation therapy might be recommended after surgery.
					</p>
					<p>
						Systemic chemotherapy: Systemic chemotherapy is an option for patients with squamous cell cancer that has spread to lymph nodes or distant organs. In some cases it’s combined with surgery or radiation therapy.	
					</p>
					<p>
						Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy is often given to people with squamous cell carcinoma before and/or after surgery. This is to shrink and destroy the tumor.
					</p>
					<p>
						Excision: This is a surgical procedure that your dermatologist often can perform during an office visit. It involves numbing the area to be treated and cutting out any remaining tumor plus some normal-looking skin around the tumor.					
					</p>
					<p>
						Downsides to treatment:
						<ul>
							<li>Fatigue</li>
							<li>Weight loss</li>
							<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
							<li>Nausea</li>
							<li>Hair Loss</li>
							<li>Cognitive Impairment</li>
							<li>Exaggerated Soreness</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h2>Stats</h2>
						<p>The true survival rate of SCC is unknown. SCC is such a minute cancer, many people who have the illness think they merely have a skin a rash and never seek a dermatologist. Fatal cases of SCC that occur is once the cancer spreads to lymph nodes, or when the patient has a disease that weakens the immune system. 2000 deaths from SCC are reported annually, worldwide. 
						</p>

						<p>Between 40 and 50 percent of Americans who live to age 65 will have either SCC, or it’s “sister disease” Basal Cell Carcinoma (which is very similar) at least once.</p>
						
						<p>Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin cancer. An estimated 700,000 cases of SCC are diagnosed each year in the US.</p>
						
						<p>DEATH FROM THIS CANCER IS VERY UNCOMMON, WHEN DIAGNOSED. More than 70% of people who report this cancer survive the ailment, even in the later stages the survival rate is extremely high in comparison to other cancers.
