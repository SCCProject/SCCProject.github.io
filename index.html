						<h3>What Causes this Disease?</h3>
						<p>
							Usually, new cells force cells toward the skin's surface, then older cells die off. Malfunctions of DNA interrupt this process, and cells to grow out of control, with squamous cell carcinoma of being the result. 
						</p>
						<p>Causes include:
							<ul>
							<li>Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) lights</li> 
							<li>The Intake of toxins
							<li>Mutations of the body
							</ul>
						</p>
						
					</div>
				<!--Signs-->
					<div class = "col-md-4">
						<div class = "thumbnail">
							<img src = "signs.jpg" />
						</div>
						<h3>Signs of SCC</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Bumps and lumps on the skin that feel rough</li>
								<li>As the bump or lump grows, it becomes dome shaped, crusty, or bloody</li>
								<li>Sores that never hear, or constantly returns</li>
								<li>Flat, red colored, scaly patches that grow and expand slowly</li>
								<li>Dark spots under finger/toe nails that get darker and slowly rot the nail</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>Who is affected by this disease? </h3>
						<p>
							Men are twice more likely to be diagnosed with SCC.

							Most SCC cases occurs in people over 50 years old.

							However more and more young people (especially women) are being diagnosed with cases due to excessive tanning.
							Also People who have fair skin, light hair, and blue, green, or gray eyes are at highest risk of developing the disease.
